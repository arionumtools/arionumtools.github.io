      <p>
      Share asset holders can make decisions through the arionum blockchain.<br>

<br><br>
The voting results need to be confirmed by more than 50% of asset holders.
       <br><br>
      
        Any asset holder can create a proposal and provide aro address.<br>
All accounts with the asset can send the minimum aro transaction to the relevant proposed account address.<br>

Related aro income is owned by the proposer.<br>
The longest voting time is one month and the shortest is no less than 10 minutes.<br> The proposer can confirm the end of the voting at any time.<br>

The system will calculate the relevant asset holdings of all transfer accounts in the next block after the voting ends.<br>
All accounts that send aro to this address own more than 50% of assets, and relevant proposals will become decisions<br>
